[A Random Effects Model-based Method of Moments Estimation of Causal Effect in Mendelian Randomization Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10926)
A new method for estimating causal effect by using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IV), especially for weak IVs and invalid IVs with pleiotropic effects. This method requires individual-level data to calculate the Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM).
