Performing fastGWA linear regression analysis...
fastGWA results will be saved in text format to [/home/saonli/cao00094/MRdata/ukb/LD01/fastGWASBPLD01.fastGWA].
  Filtering out variants with MAF < 0.0001, customise it with --maf flag.
  Filtering out variants with missingness rate > 0.10, customise it with --geno flag.
